  "report": " Hello, I'm doing fine. I'm here because I have some issues with my back, and I want to see if there's anything we can do about it.\n\nOf course, I understand. I can see that you're experiencing some discomfort. It's possible that you may have strained your back. We may need to perform some tests to determine the exact cause.\n\nYes, it hurts. I think it could be due to a minor injury or a small fracture. We'll need to investigate further to confirm.\n\nI'm sorry if I missed anything. I'll make sure to send you the results of our tests. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. Have a good day."
